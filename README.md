# Stock Price Prediction with Keras and Jupyter Notebooks

## Overview  
This project is a simple introduction to **Jupyter Notebooks**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **time series forecasting**. The goal is to use a neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Current Findings  
- The Keras neural network currently **underestimates total price and volatility**.  
- Predictions tend to be **reactive** rather than proactiveâ€”when a sudden drop occurs, the model responds rather than predicting it beforehand.  
- Further tuning and optimization are needed to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Next Steps  
- Learn more about **hyperparameter tuning** and **time series forecasting techniques**.  
- Experiment with **LSTMs, GRUs, and attention mechanisms** to improve performance.  
- Optimize feature engineering and training methodology for better predictive capability.
